## TDEE AARR
Humans of all types share a common requirement for energy in the form of calories. This energy depends on a number of factors, including age, height, weight, muscle mass, and daily activity. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the number of calories an individual burns per day to maintain their weight. According to most research, eating under your TDEE would cause weight loss and eating above your TDEE would cause weight gain. For anyone with a body composition related goal, knowing their TDEE is essential for optimizing their nutrition. 

The most common methods of estimating TDEE are through prediction models. The problem with these models is that they are often inaccurate by hundreds of calories and do not account for dynamic changes in TDEE that occur over the course of a nutritional phase. These inaccurate calculations cause people to over or underestimate their calorie intake needs. 

Not all predictive models for estimating TDEE are created equal and different populations will benefit from using different models that may be more accurate for their circumstances. The article our company wrote in Alan Aragon’s Research Review (AARR) lays out the differences between many of the popular models, and provides an evidenced-based framework of how to choose the most accurate model for an individual.

This webpage is a good start to estimating your TDEE with more accuracy than just choosing a random model, but to get a more accurate estimation of your own
